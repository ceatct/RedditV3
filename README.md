The project works as follows:
The main Activity is recyclerView, which is populated with elements that are formed using the template tred_item.xml.

The program obtains data from the json file using the Retrofit library, the Common object and the RetrofitService interface.

Image from URL in ImageView is retrieved using the Picasso library.

This is my first project on Kotlin after several projects on Java, but I gained experience with lessons and answers on StackOverflow.

When compiling, the project issued an error, the solution of which could not be found (https://imgur.com/WrKHlT7)
